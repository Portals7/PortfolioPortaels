    'Hi! My  name is Joty and ever since I was little I loved to draw. As I became older I started experimenting with Photoshop and before I knew I was taking pictures, editing them or I was making digital illustrations. I had the chance to develop this in school, and that is also where I came into contact with coding. Last year I decided to level up my coding skills by taking a front-end-development course at Intec Brussel',
